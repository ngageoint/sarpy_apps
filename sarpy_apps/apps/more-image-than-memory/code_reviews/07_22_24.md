### Issues Fixed
- [#1. Unable to locate image files outside of the source code directory](https://depot.nasic.af.mil/nasic/gsi/gsir/asrd/ast/more-image-than-memory/-/issues/1)
    - `Bug: Mission Aid` | `Priority: High`
    - The tool is unable to open NITF files that are located outside of the source code directory. The issue seems to be with how the file name is generated for opening: a `/` is applied at the front of the filename string.
- [#2. Pressing enhance to reload image after scrolling in and out](https://depot.nasic.af.mil/nasic/gsi/gsir/asrd/ast/more-image-than-memory/-/issues/2)
    - `Bug: UX` | `Priority: Normal`
    - The "Enhance" button needs to be pressed to update the image after scrolling in and out. Instead, waiting a small amount of time after the scroll wheel is no longer giving input would be better.
- [#3. Unable to open certain file extensions](https://depot.nasic.af.mil/nasic/gsi/gsir/asrd/ast/more-image-than-memory/-/issues/3)
    - `Bug: Mission Aid` | `Priority: Normal`
    - SICDs with the file extension `.ntf` do not show up in the side panel; these file extensions also need to be included.

### Discoverd Issues
- [#15. Unable to navigate to a network drive](https://depot.nasic.af.mil/nasic/gsi/gsir/asrd/ast/more-image-than-memory/-/issues/15)
    - `Bug: Mission Aid` | `Priority: Highest`
    - Unable to navigate navigate to network drive to pull imagery into the viewer.
- [#10. Metaicon not resizable](https://depot.nasic.af.mil/nasic/gsi/gsir/asrd/ast/more-image-than-memory/-/issues/10)
    - `Bug: UX` | `Priority: High`
    - Metaicon has text cutoff and is not resizable.
- [#9. Metaicon incorrect](https://depot.nasic.af.mil/nasic/gsi/gsir/asrd/ast/more-image-than-memory/-/issues/9)
    - `Bug: Mission Aid` | `Priority: High`
    - Metaicon says that the image is shadows-down, but isn't displayed that way. Image displayed as range/multipath down.
- [#8. App freezes when loading an image](https://depot.nasic.af.mil/nasic/gsi/gsir/asrd/ast/more-image-than-memory/-/issues/8)
    - `Bug: UX` | `Priority: High`
    - The entire viewer freezes when loading large images. Implement threaded image loading to avoid viewer freezing.
- [#14. Metaicon doesn't close when MITM is closed](https://depot.nasic.af.mil/nasic/gsi/gsir/asrd/ast/more-image-than-memory/-/issues/14)
    - `Bug: UX` | `Priority: Normal`
    - Closing the main window should also close any open instances of metaicon.
- [#13. Add docstrings to codebase](https://depot.nasic.af.mil/nasic/gsi/gsir/asrd/ast/more-image-than-memory/-/issues/13)
    - `Feature: Mission Aid` | `Priority: Normal`
    - Add docstrings according to PEP 257 Style Guide
- [#7. Abstracting file extensions](https://depot.nasic.af.mil/nasic/gsi/gsir/asrd/ast/more-image-than-memory/-/issues/7)
    - `Feature: Mission Aid` | `Priority: Normal`
    - Recommending pulling out the list of file extensions on line 45 and 758 in mitm_viewer.py to a location earlier in the source code and then referencing the file extension list data structure in those locations. Another option would be to pull out the list of file extensions into a .cfg file and have MITM read the options from there.
- [#4. Widget selection handler](https://depot.nasic.af.mil/nasic/gsi/gsir/asrd/ast/more-image-than-memory/-/issues/4)
    - `Feature: Mission Aid` | `Priority: Normal`
    - Add widget selection handler to MITM so RCS tool can handle the placement of ROIs on images.
- [#12. Coordinate display in corner of image](https://depot.nasic.af.mil/nasic/gsi/gsir/asrd/ast/more-image-than-memory/-/issues/12)
    - `Feature: UX` | `Priority: Low`
    - Add setting that allows the user to switch between decimal degrees and DMS.
- [#11. Add 'N' next to green arrow to denote North](https://depot.nasic.af.mil/nasic/gsi/gsir/asrd/ast/more-image-than-memory/-/issues/11)
    - `Bug: UX` | `Priority: Low`
    - Add 'N' to denote North and add Side-of-Track arrow.
- [#6. Metaicon reverts back to the original location after updating](https://depot.nasic.af.mil/nasic/gsi/gsir/asrd/ast/more-image-than-memory/-/issues/6)
    - `Bug: UX` | `Priority: Low`
    - When working with multiple images and having the metaicon display, the metaicon will revert back to the top left corner of the MITM Viewer after pressing the MetaIcon button. This blocks some of the functions on the MITM Viewer.
- [#5. Metaicon should automatically update across images](https://depot.nasic.af.mil/nasic/gsi/gsir/asrd/ast/more-image-than-memory/-/issues/5)
    - `Feature: UX` | `Priority: Low`
    - With multiple images open and clicking through the tabs, the metaicon does not update automatically. Pressing the "MetaIcon" button updates the metaicon. Additionally, abstract the method for automatically updating other UI elements.
